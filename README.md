## vacuumBar

A wrapper for the amazing [dorita980](https://github.com/koalazak/dorita980) library so you can control your Roomba through the menu bar.

### Installation

You'll need to set three env vars:

`DORITA980_MY_USERNAME_BLID`

`DORITA980_MY_PASSWORD`

`DORITA980_ROBOT_IP`

you can find these out by following the the handy guide over at the [dorita980](https://github.com/koalazak/dorita980#how-to-get-your-usernameblid-and-password) repo.

Then install the deps for this library:

`yarn install`

Then run the Electron app:

`electron index.js`

This is working as of 11/14/19 on my Mac OS X Macbook Pro running 10.14.6 Mojave.

Good luck!
